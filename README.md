## Second tas of internship creating My Portfolio with the help of Html and Css.

which consist following things ..

## Certainly! Here is a detailed explanation of how the portfolio was created and the technologies used:



1. **HTML Structure:**
   - I started by creating the basic structure of the portfolio using HTML5. The document is organized with semantic tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`, making it easy to navigate and maintain.
   - The header includes a logo and a navigation bar with links to different sections of the portfolio.
   - Each section (Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact) is clearly defined with appropriate content.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - To enhance the visual appeal of the portfolio, I used CSS3 for styling.
   - The CSS file is linked in the `<head>` section of the HTML document. It defines styles for the entire portfolio, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
   - I used Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout, ensuring that the portfolio looks great on all devices.
   - Background colors and gradients were applied to create a visually appealing design. For instance, the Home section uses a linear gradient background.
   - Custom styles were applied to various elements, such as the navigation links, buttons, and images, to make the portfolio look polished and professional.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensuring that the portfolio is responsive was a key focus. I used media queries to adjust the layout and styles for different screen sizes.
   - The navigation bar is designed to be user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices, with a fixed position to stay at the top of the page.
   - Images and text are resized and repositioned based on the screen size to provide a seamless viewing experience.

4. **Icon Integration:**
   - I integrated icons from Boxicons by linking the Boxicons CSS in the `<head>` section.
   - These icons are used for social media links in the Home section, adding a touch of professionalism and interactivity.

5. **Content Organization:**
   - The content is organized into sections for easy navigation. Each section includes headings and text that describe my skills, experience, and projects.
   - The Home section includes a brief introduction and social media links.
   - The About section provides a detailed description of my background and expertise.
   - The Skills section lists my key skills in a visually appealing manner.
   - The Projects section showcases a sample project with an image and description.
   - The Contact section provides my email and phone number, making it easy for visitors to get in touch.

### Technologies Used

1. **HTML5:**
   - Used for creating the structure and content of the portfolio.
   - Semantic tags ensure that the document is well-organized and accessible.

2. **CSS3:**
   - Used for styling the portfolio and making it visually appealing.
   - Flexbox for layout and responsiveness.

3. **Boxicons:**
